# A Course on Mathematical Theories of Deep Learning

This course is inspired by Stanford Stats 385, Theories of Deep Learning, taught by Prof. Dave Donoho, Dr. Hatef Monajemi, and Mr. Vardan Papyan, as well as the 
IAS@HKUST workshop on Mathematics of Deep Learning to be held during Jan 8-12, 2018. The aim of this course is to provide graduate students who are interested in 
deep learning a variety of mathematical and theoretical studies on neural networks that are currently available, in addition to some preliminary tutorials, to foster 
deeper understanding in future research. 

Prerequisite: There is no prerequisite, though mathematical maturity on approximation theory, harmonic analysis, optimization, and statistics, etc. will be helpful.
